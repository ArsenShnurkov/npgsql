## General

Npgsql is an open source ADO.NET Data Provider for Postgresql, it allows programs written in C#, Visual Basic, F# to access the Postgresql database server.
It allows any program developed for .Net framework to access database server. It is implemented in 100% C# code. Works with Postgresql 9.x and above.

## Compatibility

We aim to be compatible with all [currently supported Postgresql versions](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/), which means 5 years back.
Earlier versions may still work but we don't perform regression tests on them or commit to resolving issues on them.

## Non-Windows Platforms

Full compatibility on mono is a major goal of Npgsql. We run regular regression tests on mono and even contribute fixes to mono itself from time to time.
Please report any issues you find.
